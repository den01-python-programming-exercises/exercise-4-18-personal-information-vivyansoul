# Exercise 4.18 Personal Information

The program described here should be implemented in the exercise file `exercise.py`. **NB!** Do not modify the class `PersonalInformation`.

After the user has entered the last set of details (they enter an empty first name), exit the repeat statement.

Then print the collected personal information so that each entered object is printed in the following format: first and last names separated by a space (you don't print the identification number). An example of the working program is given below:

```plaintext
First name: **Jean**
Last name: **Bartik**
Identification number: **271224**
First name: **Betty**
Last name: **Holberton**
Identification number: **070317**
First name:

Jean Bartik
Betty Holberton
```
